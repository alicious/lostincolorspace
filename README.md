# LOST IN COLORSPACE #
A color blending game set for Move38 Blinks

**quickstart**: Grab a pair of attached blinks. Triple click one of them.
                See if you can make some colors, and optionally read about 
                "Paint Chips" and "Primaries" below

In Lost In Colorspace, there are three possible kinds of pieces:

* **Paint Chips** have one pulsing white face (the intake face), which can 
  absorb color when placed against the edge of another paint chip, or primary.
  * Click to undo the most recent color mixed in
  * Double Click to reset to an empty chip
  * Long Press an empty paint chip to start a two minute game timer
  * Long Press a non-empty paint chip to convert a chip to a Goal 

* **Primaries** supply different levels of a given RGB primary to paint chips.
  * Click to cycle between Red, Green, and Blue

* **Goals** are random colors to try and match by mixing with paint chips. 
  Docking a paint chip's intake face to a goal will test if the paint chip
  is close enough to pass. A close enough paint chip will do a "win spin" 
  (and will reset the goal, if not hidden, to a new random color once undocked.) 
  If the paint chip isn't close enough yet, it will pulse with a hint for what 
  color to try adding next.
  * Click to hide or unhide the goal (you can still test against a hidden goal)
  * Double click for a new random goal
  * Long Press to revert back to a paint chip of the same color

## GAMES ##


### Color Pop Quiz ###
####1 or more players ####
SET UP: 
* Give each player one goal, and one primary/chip pair to keep in hand.
* On the count of three, long press your paint chips to start the timer and score keeper.

GAME PLAY:
Successfully complete as many goals as you can before the timer is up; compare scores.
(A red wedge in the final score display indicates five points, white is one point.)
Double clicking for a new goal is fair play if all players agree.

CUTTHROAT VARIANT:
Place all goals in the middle of the table; anybody may test against any goal. Once 
a player is successful, the goal will change, so watch what others are going for!

SLIGHTLY LESS CUTTHROAT VARIANT:
As above, but you may not undock a winning piece until an opponent has attempted
a goal (not necessarily the same goal).


### Paint It Forward ###
SET UP: 
* Give each player a primary/chip pair
* Put two randmom goals in the middle of the table 
* Randomly choose a start player 
* All other players convert their paint chips to random goals and add them to the goals 
already on the table, optionally changing a goal to a new random goal as they do so.

GAME PLAY:
Play passes clockwise around the table. Each turn follows these steps in order:
1. Double click a goal (optional). You may not click the most recently tested goal.
2. Perform exactly one mix in by retrieving the paint chip and touching its 
   intake face to a primary.
3. Dock at a goal. If successful, remove the goal and set aside as your point, then
   take another turn immediately (but skip step 1). Otherwise, leave the chip docked
   and pass the turn to your left.

**note** steps 2 & 3 are mandatory, only 1 is optional

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
The first player to collect two goals as points wins the game.

FOR A LONGER GAME:
Play with more goals, and with a higher victory condition.


### Colorful Language ###
///// not yet playtested /////
SET UP:
* Give each player a primary/chip pair, and make hidden random goal (click a goal to 
hide it, then double click to randomize it while hidden). 
* Choose a player to be the first active player.
* Make a pool of ??6?? tokens/pennies/whatsits for scorekeeping.

GAME PLAY:
The active player takes the goal, and all other players close their eyes.
The active player may now click the goal to reveal it, and think of a clue
to describe the color. When they are ready, they click the goal to hide it again
and then tell the other players their clue. 

All other players now make a color following the active player's clue. 
When all players are ready, they dock at the goal.

Any player who's color was a successful match takes a token from the pool.
The active player also takes a point, as long as at least one player's color was a
successful match, but not if **all** players matched. (I.e. make your hint not too hard,
but not too obvious either).

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Play till the token-whatsit pool is empty. Player with the most whatsits wins.


### Shades of Resistance ###
--Be the shade you want to see in the world--

SET UP:
Set up the board by making a primary bank (triple click a triangle formation).
Make a pool of ??15?? blank paint chips.

Using chips from the pool, each player makes goals and adds them, with their colors 
hidden, to a goal pool. Once each player has made at least three goals, shuffle goal 
pool, then draw three goals each. You may look at your goals, but keep them hidden 
from other players for the duration of the game. 
Discard one goal of your choice.

Convert any unclaimed or discarded goals to blank paint chips. Convert any primaries
used to make the goal pool to blank paint chips, too, but leave the starting trio.

(Four player team play variant: draw two goals, keep one, and exchange color codenames 
on paper with your partner at game start)


GAME PLAY:
On your turn, you may perform exactly one of the following three actions:

1) Place: take an empty paint chip from the pool, if available, and add it to the board.

2) Move: take a piece from the board and move it to a new location.

3) Test: pull one paint chip from the board, and dock it on one of your goals if there
is room - up to three chips may be docked on a single goal. If it is successful match,
keep it in place as a point. If not successful, you must return the paint chip to the 
board, with the intake face touching the primary indicated at test failure. 
If this is not possible, clear it and return it to the pool of blank chips.

In addition: whenever you remove or place a chip, you may optionally draw color from 
one additional adjacent face. It is possible to draw at the start and end of a move
action. You may not, however, use an extra draw when resolving a test failure.
