# LOST IN COLORSPACE #
A color blending game set for Move38 Blinks

> **Quick Start**: Grab a pair of attached blinks. Triple click one of them.
>                  See if you can make some colors, and optionally read about 
>                  "Paint Chips" and "Primaries" below

In Lost In Colorspace, there are three possible kinds of pieces:

* **PAINT CHIPS** have one pulsing white face (the intake face), which can 
  absorb color when placed against the edge of another paint chip, or primary.
  * Click to undo the most recent color mixed in
  * Double Click to reset to an empty chip
  * Long Press an empty paint chip to start a two minute game timer
  * Long Press a non-empty paint chip to convert a chip to a Goal 

* **PRIMARIES** supply different levels of a given RGB primary to paint chips.
  * Click to cycle between Red, Green, and Blue

* **GOALS** are random colors to try and match by mixing with paint chips. 
  Docking a paint chip's intake face to a goal will test if the paint chip
  is close enough to pass. A close enough paint chip will do a "win spin" 
  This will reset the goal to a new random color once the paint chip is undocked.
  If the paint chip isn't close enough yet, it will pulse with a hint for what 
  color to try adding next.
  * Click to hide or unhide the goal (you can still test against a hidden goal)
  * Double click for a new random goal
  * Long Press to revert back to a paint chip of the same color


## GENERAL SET UP: ##
Different play modes will require *triple clicking* certain formations of blinks:

Triple Click          | to Make a
----------------------|-------------------
a solitary blink      | goal
a pair of blinks      | primary + paint chip
a triangle of blinks  | bank of three primaries
any other shape       | cluster of up to 7 blank paint chips



## GAMES ##


### Color Pop Quiz ###

*1 or more players*  
*3 blinks per player*

SET UP: 
* Give each player a hand of one goal, and one primary/chip pair.
* On the count of three, long press your paint chips to start the timer and score keeper.

GAME PLAY:
Successfully complete as many goals as you can before the timer is up; compare scores.
(A red wedge in the final score display indicates five points, white is one point.)
Double clicking for a new goal is fair play if all players agree.

VARIANTS:

**Cutthroat**
Place all goals in the middle of the table; anybody may test against any goal. Once 
a player is successful, the goal will change, so watch what others are going for!

**Slightly Less Cutthroat**
As above, but you may not undock a winning piece until an opponent has attempted
a goal (not necessarily the same goal).


### Paint It Forward ###

*2-? Players*
*2 blinks per player, plus 2 extra*

SET UP: 
* Give each player a primary/chip pair
* Put two random goals in the middle of the table 
* Randomly choose a start player 
* All other players convert their paint chips to random goals and add them to the goals 
  already on the table
* Each player may choose to randomize one goal
* Start player begins the game by skipping to step 2 below

GAME PLAY:
Play passes clockwise around the table. Each turn follows these steps in order:
1. Retrieve the chip from where it is docked, and optionally choose to undo the 
   previous player's move by clicking once
2. Touch the paint chip's intake face to a primary.
3. Dock at a goal. If the chip shows a match, remove the goal and set it aside 
   as your point, then take another turn immediately. If the chip does not match, 
   leave it docked, and pass the turn to your left.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
The first player to collect two goals as points wins the game.

VARIANTS:

**Player Handicaps**
Allow one or more "redo" actions in step 2 (i.e. click to undo your own action,
before trying a different primary face)

**No Random Goals**
Start the game by making goals manually - build up a color on a paint chip, 
Then long press to convert it to a goal. Skip randomizing goals at the end of setup.

**Longer Game**
Play with more goals, and with a higher victory condition.

*Memory Challenge:*
At the end of setup, once all players are ready, hide goals for the remainder of the game


### Colorful Language ###

*3+ players (with 2 player variant)*
*2 blinks per player, minus one*
///// not yet playtested for more than 2 /////

SET UP:
* Give each player a primary/chip pair, and make a  hidden random goal (click 
  a goal to hide it, then double click to randomize it while hidden). 
* Choose a player to be the first active player.
* Make a pool of ??6?? tokens/pennies/whatsits for scorekeeping.

GAME PLAY:
The active player takes the goal, and all other players close their eyes.
The active player may now click the goal to reveal it, and think of a clue
to describe the color. When they are ready, they click the goal to hide it again
and then tell the other players their clue. 

All other players now make a color following the active player's clue. 
When all players are ready, they dock at the goal.

Any player whose color was a successful match takes a token from the pool.
The active player also takes a token, as long as:
* at least one player's color was a successful match, and
* not **all** players matched successfully.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Play till the token-whatsit pool is empty. Player with the most whatsits wins.

TWO PLAYER CO-OP:
Take turns as active player, and share your points (although it's honestly fun
without even keeping score if you'd rather not bother). Try playing ten rounds
and aim for a new high score.

PLAYING WITH FEWER BLINKS:
Play with one paint chip per player, and pass a primary around until everyone
has made a color to test.

### Shades of Resistance ###
> Be the shade you want to see in the world

*2-4 players*
*18 blinks*
///// currently tested for two players with 18 blinks /////
///// need to playtest other player and blink counts /////

SET UP:
* Set up the board by making a primary bank (triple click a triangle of blinks.)
* Each player makes a number of random hidden goals, depending on player count.
  (Click a goal to hide it, and double click while hidden to randomize.)
    Players | Goals
    ----------------
     2      | 3
     3      | 2
     4      | 2
* Players look at their goals, but keep them hidden from other players for the duration 
  of the game. (Single click to hide/unhide goals. If you have some sushi roll cases
  around, they can be helpful for looking at goals without revealing to other players.)
* All players discard one goal of their choice. 
* Convert all discarded goals and any remaining blinks to blank paint chips to make a 
  starting chip pool.

GAME PLAY:
Players take turns in clockwise order, taking one action per turn.
 

**Phase 1** 
In Phase one, players take turns adding a chip from the pool to the board, optionally 
drawing color from one adjacent face before rotating into final position.
(This is equivalent to the "Place" action in Phase 2, below). 

After the chip pool is emptied for the first time, start Phase 2. 

**Phase 2**
Until the game end is triggered (see below), players perform exactly one of the following
three actions on their turn. During any action, a player may choose to a perform bonus 
color draw from an adjacent face whenever adding and/or removing a piece from the board.

1. Place: add an empty paint chip from the pool to the board, as in Phase 1.

2. Move: take a piece from the board and move it to a new location. 
  * It is possible to use a bonus color draw at both the start and end of a move action

3. Test: pull one paint chip from the board, and dock it on one of your goals.
  * If the chip is a successful match, keep it in place as a point 
  * If the chip is not a match, you must return it to the board, with the intake face 
  touching the primary indicated at test failure. If this is not possible, clear the 
  chip and return it to the pool of blank chips.
  * You may not use a bonus color draw when resolving a test failure.
  * **2 player game:** a maximum of three chips may be docked on a single goal.

**Game End**
As soon as there are only two paint chips remaining on the board and/or in the pool,
the game ends, and players count their claimed chips. The highest score wins.

In the case of a tie, tied players enter a sudden death round with the two chips
remaining on the board.

VARIANTS:

**No Random Goals**
At the start of setup, players make the starting goals manually, keeping goals
secret from other players. Once every player has made the amount listed in the setup
table, shuffle and draw the required amount. Please note that it can break the game if
you make goals that are too close to the primary colors, so how about don't. 

**Team Play (4 players)**
Form two teams of two, and sit across from your partner. At the end of setup, write a 
codename for your goal color on a piece of paper, and pass it to your partner. Play
proceeds as above, except you can additionally attempt to dock at your partner's goal,
and you only dock three chips at a goal (as in the two player game). 
The team with the highest combined point total wins the game.
